# --------------------------------------------------
# üìä Email Classification Prompt
# --------------------------------------------------

CLASSIFICATION_TEMPLATE = """
You are an email classifier. Classify each email into exactly one of the following categories:
promos, goods receipt, retailer order confirmation, retailer shipping confirmation, services receipt, shipping update, return confirmation, return update, refund, retailer order update.

Definitions:
- promos: Promotional offers, discounts, advertisements, or sales emails. These do NOT confirm any order, payment, or shipment.
- goods receipt: Proof of payment for physical goods that were delivered to the customer. These typically include detailed itemized lists, total price paid, **and an invoice number**. A price or order summary alone is NOT sufficient. Do not classify an email as goods receipt unless it clearly shows the purchase was completed and invoiced.
- retailer order confirmation: Notification from a retailer that an order has been placed or is being prepared. These emails confirm the order but do NOT mention that it has shipped or include tracking information.
- retailer shipping confirmation: Notification from a retailer that item(s) have been handed off to a carrier. This is the **first** shipping alert. It typically includes tracking number or carrier info and uses language like ‚Äúyour package has shipped‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve shipped your item‚Äù, or ‚Äúon its way‚Äù. It does NOT include delivery progress like "in transit" or "out for delivery".
- services receipt: Confirmation of payment for **non-physical services** such as rides (e.g., Uber, Lyft), bookings, event tickets, or food/restaurant delivery (e.g., DoorDash, Uber Eats).  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è All restaurant orders, food delivery, and cab or rideshare receipts ‚Äî even itemized ones ‚Äî belong to `services receipt`.
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Emails from restaurants that mention **order confirmation**, **order received**, or similar ‚Äî even if they do not show a receipt ‚Äî are still classified as `services receipt`.
- shipping update: Any **post-shipment** email that reports the **status or progress of the shipment**. These updates can include phrases like:  
  ‚Äúin transit‚Äù, ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù, ‚Äúarriving today/tomorrow‚Äù, ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù, ‚Äúrunning late‚Äù, ‚Äúrescheduled‚Äù, ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù, ‚Äúheld at facility‚Äù, etc.  
  Shipping updates may include tracking number, order ID, item list, and even **price info**, but those do NOT make it a goods receipt or shipping confirmation. The presence of **shipping status language** is what defines this category.
- retailer order update: Any **non-shipping** update from a **retailer** about an order that is not the initial order confirmation or shipping confirmation. Examples: item delayed, out of stock, backordered, or delivery date changed.
- return confirmation: The retailer's acknowledgment that a return request has been received and processing has begun. This is the **first positive response** to a return request, typically including:
  - Return authorization/approval
  - Return instructions (label, QR code, or drop-off details)
  - Items eligible for return
  - May include estimated refund amount
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Key indicator: Language confirming the return request is accepted (e.g., "Your return has been approved", "We've accepted your return request, "Return has been registered" etc").
- return update: **Shipping-related updates** about the physical return package ONLY. Must include:
  - "We've received your return package"
  - "Your return is in transit"
  - Carrier tracking updates for the return

Rules:
- üöó All rideshare or cab receipts (Uber, Lyft, etc.) = services receipt.
- üçï All restaurant orders or food delivery receipts (DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.) = services receipt ‚Äî even if itemized.
- üçΩÔ∏è **Restaurant emails that say ‚Äúyour order is confirmed‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôve received your order‚Äù** should still be classified as `services receipt`, even if they look like an order confirmation.
- A receipt for physical goods is **goods receipt** only if it includes **an invoice number** and confirms the item was delivered.
- Do NOT classify emails with just price details or item lists as goods receipt ‚Äî especially if they mention shipment progress.
- Shipping updates must contain **shipping status language**. These can be sent by **either the retailer or the carrier**.
- Retailer shipping confirmation is the **initial shipping notice** from the retailer. It introduces the shipment and often includes tracking info.
- Shipping update is any **follow-up** email that shows the shipment's progress (even if it repeats order info or tracking details).
- Return confirmation = return initiated or accepted.
- Return update = progress on return after confirmation.
- Refund = confirmation that a refund has been issued.
- Retailer order update, order confirmation, and shipping confirmation must be from the **retailer**, not a shipping provider. Use sender domain to help determine this (e.g., `@amazon.com`, `@target.com`, not `@ups.com`, `@fedex.com`).

# ü§ñ GPT Matching Fallback Prompt
# --------------------------------------------------

FALLBACK_MATCH_PROMPT = """
You are helping to identify whether a product description from a shipping email matches any item from a list of known order items.

Extracted Description:
"{short_desc}"

Known Items (list of dictionaries):
{candidates}

Instructions:
- Your task is to return the dictionary of the single best-matching item, if one exists.
- Match by **meaning**, not just exact text.
- The extracted description may be abbreviated or formatted differently.
- Match even if the wording differs but the meaning is the same.
- Use semantic reasoning. For example:
  - "5Pkt" = "5 Pocket"
  - "Blk" = "Black"
  - "*Warpstreme" = "Warpstreme"
  - "Slim-Fit" = "Slim Fit"
  - "Reg" = "Regular"
  - Ignore case, punctuation, word order differences, and asterisks.
- Focus on matching core product identity: name, style, fit, fabric, size, and color.
- If no known item matches the extracted description at all, return nothing.

Output Format:
Return ONLY the matching dictionary from the list. If no match is found, return `null`.
